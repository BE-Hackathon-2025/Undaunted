# Project Name
AisleReady
## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
**...include the challenge statement(s) the project worked to address**

AisleReady works to reduce guesswork when traveling to the airport and through TSA, especially when there are constant dynamic scheduling changes due to traffic and congestion at the airport. 

(How might we reduce guesswork when traveling to and throughout airports?)


## Project Description 🤯
**....at least 3 sentences describing what the project does and how it works**
AisleReady is a sophisticated web application designed to eliminate the guesswork of airport departure times. It intelligently synthesizes real-time data from five key sources: live traffic conditions, address location, and current and forecasted weather, official flight status, and generative AI analysis. By processing these variables, the app generates a dynamic and personalized recommendation, providing users with a precise departure time that ensures they arrive at their gate with an optimal buffer, accounting for TSA security wait times.


## Project Value 💰
**....at least 3 sentences describing your target customer and tangible benefits from your solution**
AisleReady's primary target customers are frequent business travelers and anxious leisure flyers who value punctuality and a stress-free airport experience. For these users, our solution delivers the tangible benefit of reclaimed time and reduced anxiety by providing a single, reliable departure time, eliminating the need to manually check multiple apps regarding travel. This directly translates into a smoother travel day, minimizing the risk of missed flights and the stress of unexpected delays, ensuring they start their journey with confidence.
